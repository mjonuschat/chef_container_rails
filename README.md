## Recipes

### default

Configures the system to support running Ruby on Rails web applications out of the box.
It builds on the foundation of `chef_container_baseimage` and assumes some defaults
set in there.

This image is also opinionated in what integrations it provides out of the box:
  - `sidekiq` for background job processing
  - `clockwork` for scheduling recurring application specific jobs
  - `sentry` for error monitoring and release tracking
  - `filebeat` to send `logstash` compatible logs to ElasticSearch
    The following environment variables can be used to configure filebeat:  
    **FILEBEAT_APP_NAME:** Name of the application, used as base for index and template names.  
    **FILEBEAT_ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS:** Sets the output destination, defaults to _localhost:9200_
